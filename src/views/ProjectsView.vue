        <p>
            In the last years I completed many projects successfully, and many more are coming  Here are some of them:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Online-Casino-Verluste.de : Developed a website and a backend for a client to help people who lost money in online casinos to get their money back.
                The main goal of the website is to further automate the process. It integrates with DocuSign and Email services to automatically send out documents, and requests afterwards.
                Furthermore there is an admin panel to manage the cases and the users, supporting the client in his daily work.
            </li>
            <li>
                MausMover: Developed an iOS app to make the mouse cursor move randomly to prevent the computer from locking as a small side project.
            </li>
            <li>
                ArcDPS Timer: Developed a timer for the game Guild Wars 2 to accuratly measure group performance in the game. A main challenge was to combine different data sources in order to get the most accurate results.
                These include an addon API, network, memory mapped files and keypresses, and need to be made consistent in a group of multiple players.
            </li>
