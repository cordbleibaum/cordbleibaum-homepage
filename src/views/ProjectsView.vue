        <p>
            In the last years I completed many projects successfully, and many more are coming  Here are some of them:

            <li>
                Online-Casino-Verluste.de : Developed a website and a backend for a client to help people who lost money in online casinos to get their money back.
                The main goal of the website is to further automate the process. It integrates with DocuSign and Email services to automatically send out documents, and requests afterwards.
                Furthermore there is an admin panel to manage the cases and the users, supporting the client in his daily work.

            </li>

                This website: Developed this website to showcase my skills and projects.
